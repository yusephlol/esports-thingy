      <p> Why are video games and games in general so powerful in a factor of society?&nbsp;</p>
      <p>I think that video games and games in general are extremely fun. And so do a lot of other people in society too. I think the reason they are so popular is because they are so fun. Every person who plays them only plays them for their entertainment. &nbsp;</p>
<p>My favorite genre is class based games. I like them because the replayability is very good. Plus I like to try and master every character I play because it adds more of a challenge. This game is unique because it takes the strategy and precision shooting of CSGO and combines it with the character selection of apex legends.&nbsp;</p>
