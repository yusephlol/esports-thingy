      <p>The game I will be covering is VALORANT.&nbsp; This game is a 5v5 tactical shooter.&nbsp; Each character has unique abilities which makes for some chaotic moments. The hardest move and technique is called an ace. An ace is when you yourself eliminate the entire opposing team by yourself. This extremely hard to execute and it only gets harder the better you get at the game.&nbsp; This is also very difficult because the enemies could be anywhere so you have to have good reflexes and game sense.&nbsp; This game is pretty hard to get good at but pretty easy to pick up. For noobs an ace is extremely hard to get but for intermediate and advanced players it is something that you might get regularly. The way to play valorant is to choose your agent which best fits your play style. Ten you and your team start the game off with 800 dollars which you can buy guns and weapons. But the better you do in rounds the more money you get which you can buy better guns and stronger armor. Your abilities also cost money&nbsp; so you have to use them smartly. The strategies I would recommend is to not be impatient. Unlike other games out right now valorant is all about patience and waiting for the enemy to make the first move. If you are on the opposing side you have to check all your corners and everywhere an enemy might be. The game is easy to pick up but difficult to master.&nbsp;</p>
